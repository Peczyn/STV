# Sierpinski Triangle Visualizer

This Java project visualizes the creation of the Sierpinski Triangle using the Swing library. The Sierpinski Triangle is a fractal described by the mathematician Wacław Sierpiński and is formed by recursively subdividing an equilateral triangle into smaller equilateral triangles.

## About the Sierpinski Triangle

The Sierpinski Triangle is a fascinating fractal pattern that emerges from simple rules. It is created by dividing an equilateral triangle into smaller equilateral triangles and recursively repeating the process. The result is a mesmerizing geometric pattern with self-similar properties at different scales.

## Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Swing library (included in JDK)
- Command Line (or any Java IDE)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sierpinski-triangle.git
